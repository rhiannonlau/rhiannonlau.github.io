        <h1 class="white">About Me</h1>
        <p class="white large">Hi! I hope you've enjoyed my portfolio website thus far.</br></br>
            If you're looking for my technical and career experience, you can find that here on my <a href="resumePage.html" class="yellow">resume page</a>.
            Otherwise, let me introduce myself a little further beyond the logistical details.</br></br>
            My name is Rhiannon Lau, I am currently majoring in computer science at a Canadian university.
            I first thought to create a website like this in early 2023,
            but it was not until early 2024 when I discovered the how fun and satisfying it is to make a website during one of my courses that I began the actual design and creation,
            and I have been consistently updating and maintaining it since.
            It was during this time when I also began taking on more personal and academic projects that I thought were fit to be shown in a portfolio such as this,
            such as the <a href="" class="yellow">Task Manager project</a> and the <a href="" class="yellow">Singing Willow Farm Website commission</a>.</br></br>
            Both my parents had a passion for computer science, and they introduced me to my first coding application when I was 8 years old: Scratch.
            Scratch was as much a coding application as it was a game to me, and it was the first step into a much larger world that I've become so passionate about.</br></br>
            When I'm not coding or studying, some other hobbies I love to do in my free time include gaming, cooking and baking, sewing clothes, and reading.</br></br>
            Here are some fun facts about me:</br>
        </p>
            <ul class="white large" style="list-style-type:disc; padding-left: 100px;">
                <li>In addition to English, I speak French, Cantonese, and I'm learning Korean</li>
                <li>I have a black belt in judo</li>
                <li>I am an NLS-certified lifeguard</li>
                <li>I finished RCM grade 8 piano</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="white large">
            Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.</br>
